## Concept

The spark that inspired this project is [this video](https://youtu.be/PlUmG3CFadw).

The ultimate goal is that of constructing an autonomous, real-size, realistic robotic duck, capable of filming and  sensing the surrounding surface as well as underwater environment; in particular, it should be able to get relatively close to real ducks in order to shoot photos and make videos from a genuine duck's perspective. During operations, CyberDuck will be connected to the internet via a 4G cellular network.
 
## Hardware

### 3D Model

CyberDuck's hull have been designed on the basis of [this](https://www.simscale.com/projects/kelvin_yu4/duccc/) free 3D common mallard's model; the propellers' 3D models have been generated by Caeses's free online [B-Series Propeller Generator](https://www.wageningen-b-series-propeller.com/). Everyhting else have been created in Autodesk Fusion 360.

### Simplified Schematics

![Simplified schematics](https://www.fuw.edu.pl/~gmoreno/pix/schematics.jpg)

### Onboard Computer

- BeagleBone Blue
- 64GB MicroSDXC card
- 10x USB 2.0 Hub

### Communications

- Modem 4G HUAWEI E3372H

### Sensors, Cameras and Interfaces

- GPS receiver OKYSTAR OKY3552
- Weather Station I2C BME280
- Underwater Temperature Sensor TMP35
- Turbidity Sensor for Arduino Gravity SEN0189
- Compact Optical Dust Sensor Sharp GP2Y1010AU0F
- IR Cut 850nm LED infrared Night Vision USB Camera Module ELP CMOS OV7725
- USB Camera Module ELP CMOS OV9712
- USB waterproof endoscope
- External audio USB adapter UGREEN 017735
- Microphone
- Waterproof Loudspeaker

### Custom Boards

- Interface board: it connects the turbitdity, dust and underwater temperature sensors with the BeagleBone's analog and digital ports and it drives the BeagleBone processor's cooling fan; it draws low-power 5Vcc and 3.3Vcc from BeagleBone's own prototyping power rail, as well as from one of the brushless DC motor drivers' battery eliminator circuit (5Vcc).

![Interface board](https://www.fuw.edu.pl/~gmoreno/pix/CyberDuck_Schematics.jpg)

- Power board: it draws 11.1 Vcc directly from the 3S LiPo batteries and it feeds it to the DC-DC converter; the 5Vcc power rail feeds 4 plugs and an unalthered 11.1Vcc plug serves to power the BeagleBone.

### Power Plant

- Brushless DC motor FOXY G2 C2212-900 (2x)
- ZTW Beatles Series 30A Brushless ESC (2x)
- URUAV 11.1V 10Ah 30/60C 3S Lipo battery XT90 Plug (2x)
- Step-down DC-DC converter 3A OKYSTAR OKY3504-0
- Audio amplifier 3W OKYSTAR OKY2110

### Ground Control

- Gamepad LOGITECH G PAD F310 940-000135

## Software

We used [this](http://debian.beagleboard.org/images/bone-debian-9.4-lxqt-armhf-2018-06-17-4gb.img.xz) BeagleBone debian image: it comes with pre-installed ArduPilot.
