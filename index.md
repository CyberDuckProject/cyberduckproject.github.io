## Concept

The spark that inspired this project is [this video](https://youtu.be/PlUmG3CFadw).

The ultimate goal is that of constructing an autonomous, real-size, realistic robotic duck, capable of filming and  sensing the surrounding surface as well as underwater environment; in particular, it should be able to get relatively close to real ducks in order to shoot photos and make videos from a genuine duck's perspective. During operations, CyberDuck will be connected to the internet via a 4G cellular network.
