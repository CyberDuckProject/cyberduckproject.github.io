# CyberDuck: Hardware


## 3D Model

CyberDuck's hull have been designed on the basis of [this](https://www.simscale.com/projects/kelvin_yu4/duccc/) free 3D common mallard's model; the propellers' 3D models have been generated by Caeses's free online [B-Series Propeller Generator](https://www.wageningen-b-series-propeller.com/). Everyhting else have been created in Autodesk Fusion 360.

## Custom Boards

- Interface board: it connects the turbitdity, dust and underwater temperature sensors with the BeagleBone's analog and digital ports and it drives the BeagleBone processor's cooling fan; it draws low-power 5Vcc and 3.3Vcc from BeagleBone's own prototyping power rail, as well as from one of the brushless DC motor drivers' battery eliminator circuit (5Vcc).

- Power board: it draws 11.1 Vcc directly from the 3S LiPo batteries and it feeds it to the DC-DC converter; the 5Vcc power rail feeds 4 plugs and an unalthered 11.1Vcc plug serves to power the BeagleBone.
